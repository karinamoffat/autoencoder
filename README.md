## Autoencoder for MNIST Classification
Built using the torchvision library and the autoencoderMLP4Layer model, along with a custom training loop, this model learns to reconstruct images from the MNIST dataset. The autoencoder compresses the input images into a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstructs them, learning efficient features that can be used for classification.
